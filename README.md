# Local-Pass-the-Message-Project

What you should see:

1. After you enter text into the input box, upon pressing the “Enter” key, your message should show up in the “Last Message Delivered” Section.
2. After the “Enter” key is pressed, the text box value should return to an empty text box.
3. If no input is submitted, an alert should show (using the ‘show' class in the CSS file) in the “Last Message Delivered” section and then disappear after 2 second.
